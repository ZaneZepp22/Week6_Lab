# Week6_Lab
This is a repository for the Week6 assignments.

The group consists of Zane Zeppuhar and Sherryl Augustine.

Zane added Weather.ipynb which asks for temp and tells you whether you need a jacket.
The first line takes in your name into the variable 'name'. The next line takes in the temperature you enter and converts it to an integer variable. The final part of the program is an if statement that prints out a statement depending on what the temperature is outside, so if it is 65 degrees or higher then you won't need a jacket, but if it is lower than that you will need a jacket. The following block of code is the if statement that is used. 
```python
if temp < 65:
    print(name, ", you may need a jacket today")
else:
    print(name, ", you won't need a jacket today")
```
